# vocable
New version of the game is released with cleaner code and better performance. Check vocable2 in my repositories.

Vocable is a word game where a participant should say and spell a word that starts with the ending letter of the opponent's word.

 For example, if there are two players A and B, and player A begins by saying and spelling 'LOGO', the player B should say and spell a word starting with 'O'. This should go on and on untill one of them is out of words.

Players can agree on additional rules such as, only nouns allowed, only British spellings allowed etc.
